                    *   Have been trading for at least 6 months.

                *   **A:** We typically require your last 6 months of business bank statements and a form of ID. In some cases, we may request further information, but we aim to keep paperwork to a minimum.
            *   **Q: What if my business has a poor credit history?**
                *   **A:** We look beyond just credit scores. While we do conduct credit checks as part of our final assessment, we consider your business's overall health and recent performance. We encourage businesses with varied credit histories to apply.

        *   **Category: Costs & Repayments**
            *   **Q: How much does the funding cost?**
                *   **A:** We charge a fixed, pre-agreed cost for the advance. This total cost is made clear to you upfront, so there are no hidden fees or surprises. The specific cost will depend on our assessment of your business and the advance amount and term.
            *   **Q: How do repayments work?**
                *   **A:** Repayments are made through small, regular automated payments (either daily or weekly) from your business bank account. These are designed to be manageable and align with your business's cash flow.
            *   **Q: Are there any penalties for early repayment?**
                *   **A:** No, QuickCap Ltd does not charge any penalties if you decide to repay your advance early.

            *   **Q: Is the funding secured?**
                *   **A:** Our business advances are typically unsecured, meaning you generally don't need to provide specific assets as collateral. A personal guarantee from the director(s) is usually required.
            *   **Q: Will applying affect my credit score?**
                *   **A:** Submitting an initial application for a quote will not affect your credit score as we typically perform a soft search initially (if any). A hard credit search, which can be visible to other lenders, is usually only conducted once you decide to proceed with an offer.
